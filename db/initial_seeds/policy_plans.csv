0,0,E&C in EU,European Green Deal,"With 75% of its GHG emissions coming from the energy sector, the EU has launched the European Green Deal in an effort to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.","The Deal comprises multiple strategies towards reaching climate neutrality. With the goal of cleaner energies, it is focused on ensuring a secure energy supply, promoting renewables and increasing energy efficiency. The objectives of the Deal are legally binding through the Climate Law. Supplementary strategies, such as the Climate Pact, are formulated to ensure that all member states have equal access to knowledge to guide them towards a sustainable future.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/zf74KGVOhm4,,WindEurope,false
1,1,Youth in EU,EU Youth Strategy,"Adopted in November 2018, the new EU Youth Strategy serves as the framework for EU youth policy cooperation for 2019-2027 and aims to make young people a cornerstone of the future democratic Union.","The EU Youth Strategy (EUYS) 2019-2027 is based upon three core objectives: Engage, Empower and Connect. It aims to engage young people in civic, democratic and active participation, to ensure that quality youth work is supported on all levels and young people are empowered to live their independent lives. In addition, the EUYS aims to enhance mobility and accessibility for all youth, through volunteering and solidarity activities. The EUYS is built on the foundations outlined in the Youth Strategy 2010-2018 and the results of EU Youth Dialogue sessions. The new version (the EUYS) includes expanded target areas for each goal and is different in one major respect from its predecessor: although this area was implicitly covered previously, the Youth Goal #6 “Moving Rural Youth Forward” is a new addition in the EUYS.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/pTkbW1ZXQ9Q,,European Youth Goals,true
2,2,E&C in Germany,Energiewende,"In 2010, Gemany passed the Energiewende, a comprehensive plan to significantly reduce its GHG emissions and generate 60% of energy from renewables by 2050. Click here to learn more about this plan.","The Energiewende continues to be the defining feature of Germany’s energy policy landscape. It is a major plan for transforming the German energy system into a more efficient one supplied mainly by renewable energy sources and without electricity generation from nuclear by the end of 2022. Furthermore, coal, Germany's largest source of power generation today, is planned to be fully phased out by 2038. Energy policy in Germany is enacted and enforced at the local and federal levels through legislation and regulation. Several factors affect the feasibility of energy policy, such as the availability of energy resources, energy security, the cost of energy production, consumer demand and potential impacts to the environment.",,,,false
3,3,Youth in Germany,Germany's National Youth Strategy,"No national youth strategy developed jointly by the federal states (Länder) and authorities exists in Germany. However, there are individual youth strategies both at national level and in various regions and local communities that build on the notion of an Independent Youth Policy (Eigenständige Jugendpolitik). The federal states (Länder) and local authorities have their own action plans, known as youth plans (Jugendpläne).","The federal government's Youth Strategy (Jugendstrategie) is based on the concept of the Independent Youth Policy (Eigenständige Jugendpolitik). Independent Youth Policy puts the interests and needs of young people at the centre. It considers youth as a separate stage of life characterised by three core challenges that young people face: the acquisition of life skills (Qualifizierung), finding their own position in the world (Selbstpositionierung), and empowering them to take responsibility for themselves (Verselbstständigung). This plan does not have a time frame and it is applied alongside the EU Youth Strategy 2019–2027, which includes measures to be implemented in different sectors.",,,,false
4,4,E&C in Italy,Italy's National Energy and Climate Plan,"Italy's National Energy and Climate Plan is not just an energy strategy but a change of paradigm. Indeed, it is a balanced transition that tackles climate change without leaving anyone behind.","The Italian Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (INECP) 2030 marks the beginning of an important change in Italy's energy and environmental policy towards decarbonization. It revolves around 5 lines of action to be developed in an integrated way: decarbonization, energy efficiency, energy security, the development of the internal energy market, research, innovation and competitiveness. The goal is to create a new energy policy that ensures full environmental, social and economic sustainability of the national territory while supporting this transition.",,,,false
5,5,Youth in Italy,Italy's National Youth Policy,"When it comes to youth policies, the Italian government adopts a dual approach, articulated in the development and promotion of two categories of measures: actions that directly target young people; integration actions, based on a transversal approach, in all areas that affect the lives of young people. Youth policies are based on an institutional dialogue between the Government and local autonomies in which financial resources, objectives and priorities for intervention in the field of youth policies are defined.","Every year, in the ""Unified Conference"", the Government, the Regions and the Autonomous Provinces sign a formal agreement to establish the reference framework for youth-related objectives and projects. With reference to the share allocated to the Regions and the Autonomous Provinces, the new agreement of 2020 sets the following priorities: the inclusive participation of young people in the social and political life of the territories, so that they can participate in decision-making and guide policies aimed at the targeted audience; projects that promote active and direct participation of young people in cultural and sporting activities, including through the use of the national Youth Card; activities of orientation and dissemination of good practices, aimed at the prevention of juvenile distress, particularly new addictions affecting the younger generations.

8,8,E&C in Slovenia,Slovenia's National Energy and Climate Plan,"Following extensive consultations and assessment efforts, and with public interest in terms of energy and climate at its core, Slovenia’s NECP is set to put the country on the path towards achieving climate neutrality by 2050.","In accordance with EU regulations, the NECP tackles energy efficiency, renewable energy, greenhouse gas emissions, electricity interconnections, and research and innovation (R&I). It is a plan for the period up to 2030, and its main objectives are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 36%; 35% improvement in energy efficiency; a 27% share of renewable energy sources, which should in the next update be increased; and an expenditure in R&I of 3.6% of GDP. Slovenia also aims to self-produce 75% of their consumed energy. The NECP includes provisions to significantly reduce coal dependency in Slovenia over the next decade, and the progressive elimination of subsidies for fossil fuels. The policy still faces challenges and limitations, which have been pointed out in the report drawn up by the European Union. In the face of these, Slovenia insists on the importance of research and innovation, which should eventually facilitate the coexistence with nature of hydropower plants, which are envisaged to allow coal to be phased out, together with solar and wind energy. Still, the goals set for 2030 are, in most areas, not very ambitious, and references to air quality are lacking. Want to know more?

9,9,Youth in Slovenia,Slovenia's National Youth Programme,"Youth policy in Slovenia is a cross-cutting policy area, therefore legislative provisions targeting youth are included in education, health, employment and housing policy (among others). Nevertheless, there is a framework to ensure that young people’s needs are included and promoted in national policy plans: the National Youth Programme 2013-2022.","The National Youth Programme (NYP) is a horizontal guideline aimed at coordinating actions and policy strategies regarding the youth sector at national level. It is an independent strategy. Its scope is inter-jurisdictional, meaning that the NYP aims at guiding other ministries in developing legislation which ensures protection and fostering of the youth sector. The procedure for the NYP is determined by the Public Interest Act on the Youth Sector (ZIJMS) and the Youth Council Act.The Programme is based on the Youth 2010 Study. The objectives of the NYP are in line with the European Youth Strategies. The NYP aims to provide better educational opportunities for young Slovenians, with formal and non-formal training and to better young people’s competences and chances of employment. It aims to foster mobility abroad of young people and to improve quality of employment and better work-life balance. ",,,,false
