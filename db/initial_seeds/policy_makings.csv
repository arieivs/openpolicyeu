0,0,EU,0,E&C,"The adoption of an EU energy policy involves three institutions:the Commission, the Parliament and the Council of the EU. The procedure starts with the Commission, the executive body or “government” of the EU, who presents a legislative proposal to the Parliament and the Council. The Parliament, one of the two “co-legislators” of the EU, conducts a ""first reading"", where it either approves or amends the proposal. If the Council of the EU agrees, the proposal is approved, otherwise it goes back to Parliament for a ""second reading"". This back-and-forth, also called “trilogue negotiations” has the Parliament and Council working closely together (with negotiations mediated by the Commission). If no agreement is reached, a Conciliation Committee is formed. If this does lead to an agreement, the Commission must submit a new proposal.",,,

It starts with a legislative proposal submitted by the European Commission (EC) to the European Parliament (EP) and the Council of the EU. Both the EP and the Council have to agree on a proposal or amended drafts, for it to be adopted. A proposal can be amended up to two times before special negotiations begin. This negotiation stage is called Conciliation and a Committee composed of representatives of the EP, the Council and the EC discusses the proposal for a maximum of six weeks. Eventually, a vote to approve or reject the proposal will take place.

2,1,Germany,0,E&C,"In Germany the Federal Parliament (Bundestag), the Government and the Federal Council (Bundesrat) all have the right to introduce draft bills; however, the Bundestag is the first decision-making body. A proposed law needs to undergo a threefold reading process. During the first reading, the Bundestag discusses the general outline of it and the proposal is sent to an expert committee. In the second reading, the Bundestag discusses the expert committee's deliberations and can amend the bill before a final decision is taken after the third reading. Finally, laws are passed by a majority of votes cast and promulgated by the President after countersignature of the Federal Chancellor and competent Federal Ministers and promulgated in the Federal Law Gazette.

4,2,Italy,0,E&C,"The Constitution states that the legislative function must be exercised jointly by the two Houses of Parliament: The Chamber of Deputies and the Senate (Article 70).The ordinary legislative procedure works as follows: presentation of a draft law; approval by the House of Parliament before which it is first presented; transmission of the text to the other House for approval in the same form or with amendments; possible ""shuttling"" between the two Houses of the text amended several times, until it is approved by both in the same form; promulgation by the President of the Republic, who also has the power to refer bills back to Parliament for reconsideration; publication in the Official Journal; implementation. In addition to the ordinary procedure, there are two shortened procedures: the examination and approval of the draft law by the Commission in the legislative framework (the bill, however, is submitted to the Assembly if the Government or a tenth of the deputies or a fifth of the Commission request so); the examination by the Commission at the drafting stage. In this case the Commission, specifically appointed by the Assembly, prepares a text of the bill for the Assembly, which however retains only the vote of the articles and the final vote, without being able to modify it. For energy and climate policymaking, several Ministries collaborate in the diffierent stages. In particular, the Ministry of Ecological Transition was named competent authority in 2021 for issues connected to energy and climate.",,,

6,3,Portugal,0,E&C,"Generally, the legislative process starts with a proposal by members of the Assembly of the Republic (Parliament) or by the Government, which is discussed and voted upon by the Assembly. If the proposal is approved, it becomes a ‘Decree of the Assembly’ which requires the final approval of the President of the Republic to become ‘Law of the Republic’. The field of Energy and Climate is a policy area where the EU and the national government share competences (Art 4 TFEU). The formulation of the Portuguese Energy and Climate Policy (PNEC) 2030 includes the contribution - via public consultation and the elaboration of a Strategic Environmental Assessment - of civil society and of several stakeholders within different sectors. The competent authority is the Committee for Climate Action (CAC) which supervises the application and fulfillment of the PNEC 2030 goals. In addition,the CAC is aided by the PNEC 2030 Coordination Group and by governmental entities included in the National System of Policies and Measures (SPeM).

7,3,Portugal,1,Youth,"Portugal has three levels of governance: Central, Regional (Autonomous Regions of the Azores and of Madeira) and Local. At Central level, the XXII Constitutional Government established that youth policy is a transversal competence. This means that several government bodies collaborate to formulate youth policy; the competent authorities for youth matters are the Portuguese Institute for Sport and Youth (IPDJ) and the Secretary of State for Youth and Sport. In addition, article 70 of the <a href=“https://www.parlamento.pt/sites/EN/Parliament/Documents/Constitution7th.pdf” target=“_blank” class=“text-link”>Constitution of the Portuguese Republic</a> protects the economic, social and cultural rights of young people.
