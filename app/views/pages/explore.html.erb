      <p>In parliamentary democracies, the policy process is not linear, as it is based on the information available and new discoveries. This process is a flexible and collaborative framework. Thatâ€™s how it goes:</p>

            <p>A crisis (financial, sanitary, etc) or a long-existing problem which previous policies did not solve comes to the forefront of a government political agenda.</p>

            <p>Policy makers inform themselves on the topic (and ask for independent research if needed), to draft a policy proposal. Ideally, one of the proposals is chosen only by looking at each costs and benefits ("rational choice" theory). In practice, political beliefs also come into play.</p>

            <p>The legislative process varies a lot from country to country, but it always ends with the legislative authorities voting on the proposal. If it gets a green light, we move to the next step. If not, sometimes it can be changed and re-submitted.</p>

            <p>The executive body decides what's the best way to put the adopted legislation into practice, and applies it using different procedures and regulatory bodies. Usually it needs to be harmonized among different levels (e.g: national and EU levels).</p>

      <h2><mark class="mark-yllw">EU Power of Legislation</mark></h2>
      <p>For the EU to legislate and carry out policy decisions, the competent authorities need to provide the Union with the powers to do so. Only the Member States - being sovereign states - can do that and by doing so they lose part of their authority on specific matters.</p>
      <p>EU power of legislation must respect certain limits and principles:</p>

            <h3><mark class="mark-blue">Legal basis</mark></h3>
            <p>The EU cannot decide to intervene in a specific policy area outside the express permission granted to it in the Treaties. Checks and balances are put in place to oversee this aspect.</p>

        <h3><mark class="mark-blue">EU legislation</mark></h3>
        <p>The body of EU law is also known as <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/acquis.html" target="_blank" class="text-link"><em>acquis communautaire</em></a> and must be included into national legislation for new Member States, it is non-negotiable and fundamental for joining the EU. Current Member States are also required to implement EU regulations and directives into their national legislation by the process of <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-making-process/applying-eu-law_en" target="_blank" class="text-link">transposition</a>.</p>
        <p>The Commission monitors procedures and correct implementation. The process varies from one Member State to another.  Member States hold a monopoly of executive power for policies adopted by ordinary legislative procedure, although failing to implement EU legislation into national one may result in judiciary actions (e.g. <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-making-process/applying-eu-law/infringement-procedure_en" target="_blank" class="text-link">Infringement Procedure</a>).</p>

      <p>The EU policymaking process results in a unique kind of politics, given its nuances and different institutional mixes and behaviours. Therefore, to better understand it there is a need for specific terminology defining the types of legal acts of the Union.</p>
