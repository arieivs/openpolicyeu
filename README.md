# OpenPolicy Europe

The digital hub for understanding and engaging with policymaking

<br />

## 🤔 What is OpenPolicy Europe?
Today, there is a **lack of youth engagement in policymaking**.
Our lack of understanding of the policymaking process keeps us from participating in a more effective way.
We decided to **build OpenPolicy Europe to fix this**.

OpenPolicy Europe will be the first **digital hub for understanding and engaging with policy** at European and Member State levels.
It is a tool that allows you to get a better understanding of how the policymaking process works, who’s involved, what policies are in place where, and how you can get involved in policy making.
